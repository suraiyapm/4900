>This link explains what CUNY Academic Commons is, along with key features and potential uses and practical application examples!

[Click here for the official getting-started guide!](https://help.commons.gc.cuny.edu/getting-started-with-the-commons/)
>This link covers all you need to know for your initial account activation. Having a campus email address is a requirement, but you can contact the email on the site to request a registration code if you don't have a CUNY email address.

These two links contain a plethora of information regarding these initial topics, along with several screenshots for clarity.

There's also some useful information regarding Commons available at [this](https://guides.cuny.edu/digital-toolkit/exhibits/cuny-academic-commons) CUNY link.

[Here](https://help.commons.gc.cuny.edu/our-tools/) are some features of Commons, with descriptions and additional information if you click the list item links. You can also click [here](https://help.commons.gc.cuny.edu/commons-basics/) for an overview of several topics, each linked with additional information! These include a section for the [Account Settings Tab](https://help.commons.gc.cuny.edu/personal-settings/), with information regarding things like changing your password/email/profile photo, profile visibility, email notifications, and more.


There's a lot of functionality in WordPress, and [this](https://help.commons.gc.cuny.edu/wp-basics/) link provides some great information on the actual WordPress side of things. 

I'll go over a few specifics below, especially for things more specific to this specific website, but for general information on use, that link may be best. It goes over each individual topic, including adding content, menus, widgets, themes, plugins, and much, much more.

## Miscellaneous Details Specific to Brooklyn College CIS Connect

### Calendars

`CIS Events` is the current calendar added for the website (which you can find from clicking Dashboard>Calendars). From clicking that, you can edit some settings, such as **Calendar Start**, **Earliest Event**, and **Latest Event**.

![alt text](<media/Guide Photos/Calendar1.png>)

It is currently set to:
- Start Day: Today
- Earliest Event: 2 Months before start date
- Latest Event: 1 Year after start date

If you click the **Appearance** tab on the left, you can alter some visual details, such as the default calendar span, colors, etc.

If you click the **Google Calendar** tab, you'll see the Calendar ID for the calendar you selected in the list from Dashboard>Calendars. `CIS Events` is based on a Google Calendar, and the ID ends in `@import.calendar.google.com`. For adding calendars, you'd want to find that ID from your own public Google calendar.

Under **Advanced**, you can find things such as time format, date format, timezone, and a few other similarly less frequently used details. It also includes the **Refresh Interval**, which is currently set to **2 hours**.



### Posts

From the Dashboard, you can click the `Posts` tab (Dashboard>Posts) to view all posts. From this view, you can perform **Bulk actions** by selecting multiple posts. From this list view, you can also edit the posts (or quick edit for minor changes), and alter things such as categories and tags.

You can click `Add Post` to create a new post, and edit it as you wish! On the editor tab to the right, you can perform block or post edits. You can choose which categories to apply to your post (from existing ones), or create new categories. Tags work similarly. These details can be changed at any time.

Under `Post` in the settings on the right, you'll see something like `Discussion    Open`. If you click it, you will see this:

![Posts1](<media/Guide Photos/Posts1.png>)

As shown above, you can mark a post **Open** or **Closed** based on whether or not you want visitors to be able to comment and reply to them. Altering this later on will not remove existing comments.

The block editor is considerably intuitive, you can click the `+` icon at the top left or type `/` to view `Blocks`, which are essentially the base elements system in WordPress.
You can come up with any arrangement of blocks that you'd like for your posts, but if you'd rather not create a new format, you also have the option of clicking `Patterns` in the menu on the left (available if you click the `+`).
![Posts2](<media/Guide Photos/Posts2.png>)
This menu has several categories, and each one has a selection of patterns available for use on posts and pages in general. These are basically just element/block groups, for instance a specific format with images and some text.

Once your post is ready and you feel prepared to click `Publish`, you'll see this menu:
![Posts3](<media/Guide Photos/Posts3.png>)
From here, you can assign categories and tags, in case you haven't already. Additionally, you can alter the visibility of your post, so that it can be visible to everyone, admins/editors, or remain password protected.
You can also `schedule` posts from this menu! Under **Publish**, you can either set a post to be published immediately, or schedule it for a later date and time. This can be very useful for getting ahead of future events! Whether it's to release event flyer posts more consistently and regularly, or to schedule them so that they're only released once an event is meant to be made public, this feature should definitely be taken advantage of. You can also save a draft, so you can start a post and save it as a draft to be completed later on.

As more posts are added, the "Archives" block on the `right` widget column in Default Template pages of the site (sidebars are not shown on some Full Width/Wide pages) will automatically add more months and years. When clicked, those lead to a page displaying all the posts from that month. On the `left` sidebar, the "Tag Cloud" block will automatically add tags from posts, and the tags more frequently used will appear larger in size than tags that are used less frequently.
